			<p>
				1)	Write a web service to look up all POIs in a given region.
			<li><a href="pointsofinterestT1.html">View Task 1</a></li>
			</p>
			<p>
				2)	Write a web service to look up all POIs in a given region AND of a given type (e.g. all pubs in Hampshire). If you like, this can be done in the same script as task 1 but this is not required.
			<li><a href="pointsofinterestT2.html">View Task 2</a></li>
				</p>
				<p>
					3)	Write a web service to add a POI to the database. Errors should be communicated to the client using HTTP codes.
			<li><a href="addnewpoiT3.html">View Task 3</a></li>
					</p>
			<p>
				4)	Write a web service to review a given POI. Again, errors should be communicated to the client using HTTP codes.
			<li><a href="searchpoitoreviewT4.html">View Task 4</a></li>
			</p>
			<p>
				5)	Write an AJAX front end for PointsOfInterest which connects to the web service, and in doing so, allows users to look up all POIs in a given region (e.g. Hampshire, Normandy, California, etc). Each matching POI's details should be shown on the AJAX interface.
			<li><a href="ajaxregionT5.html">View Task 5</a></li>
			</p>
			<p>
				6)	A third-party website, VisitHampshire, is a tourist information site for the county of Hampshire. It should allow its own users to look up POIs of a given type, by contacting PointsOfInterest's web service - it should not use its own database. Write this.
			<li><a href="visithampshireT6.html">View Task 6</a></li>
			</p>
			<p>
				7)	Add web maps (e.g. Leaflet) to PointsOfInterest's AJAX front end, and, using geolocation, display a map of the area the user is currently in. In addition, on PointsOfInterest's own site, the user should be able to enter a region (e.g. Hampshire, Normandy, California, etc) in the user interface, and then all POIs in that region will be shown on the map as markers.
			<li><a href="ajaxmapT7.html">View Task 7</a></li>
			</p>
			<p>
				8)	VisitHampshire (NOT PointsOfInterest) should allow a user to review a POI, by interacting with the web service. This requirement should be linked with requirement 6.
			<li><a href="">View Task 8</a></li>
			</p>
			<p>
				9)	A user should be able to add a point of interest by clicking on the map. The user must be able to input the details of the point of interest. The point of interest must be saved in the database by interacting with the appropriate web service, and a marker displayed as soon as the web service sends a response back to the client (and not before).
			<li><a href="">View Task 9</a></li>
			</p>
			<p>
				10)	As the user moves the map, POIs in the currently-visible area should be shown (you will need to write a new web service for this). Details of the POI (including the description) should appear when the user clicks a marker.
			<li><a href="">View Task 10</a></li>
			</p>
			<p>
				11)	The AJAX front end should also allow a user to review a point of interest, by interacting with the web service. This must be done fully with JavaScript and AJAX; the user must not be directed to a new page. Ideally, the marker popups should be linked to the review facility.
			<li><a href="">View Task 11</a></li>
